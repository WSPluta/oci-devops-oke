2. Click on **Projects**

    ```bash
    <copy>git clone --branch dev https://github.com/oracle-devrel/redbull-pit-strategy.git</copy>
    ```

  > NOTE: Make sure you select the compartment, or that the root compartment is selected.

4. You will find code repositories, that contain the mirrored GitHub Repository.

  > NOTE: OCI DevOps can host your code without the need of GitHub or any other git service. This is the preferred way, for security and integration, it is the easiest way. In this workshop, we take the approach of GitHub so you can see a more complex scenario with a minutely synchronized mirroring between OCI DevOps Code Repository and Github.

5. Click on the mirrored repository to take a look at the code.

  > NOTE: Take into account that the initial code mirroring takes a few minutes. The system will tell you if the process is on-going.

## Task 2: Run Build Pipeline

1. Scroll to the bottom to see the same code you have on GitHub.

4. Take a look, there are two stages: **Build Services** and **Deliver Artifacts**. The first stage will build the Node and Java Applications. The second stage will deploy the container images with the applications on Oracle Cloud Container Registry.
